\section{Installation and Usage}
\subsection{Installing \LaTeX\ with \texttt{MiKTeX}}
MiKTeX provide an up-to-date distribution of \LaTeX\ that comes with cross-platform installers and an integrated package manager.

To install MiKTeX:
\begin{methodology0}
  \item Download the relevant installer from: \href{https://miktex.org/download}{https://miktex.org/download}
  \item For Windows, follow the instructions available at: \href{https://miktex.org/howto/install-miktex}{https://miktex.org/howto/install-miktex}
\end{methodology0}

\subsection{Installing the \uswdwmspkg{}}
\subsubsection{Basic}
\begin{methodology0}
  \item Download the \uswdwmspkg{},as a ZIP archive, from:\\
    \href{https://github.com/david-wm-sanders/latex-package-uswdwms/archive/master.zip}{\faGithub\ https://github.com/david-wm-sanders/latex-package-uswdwms/archive/master.zip}
  \item Extract the archive to a new project directory
\end{methodology0}

\subsubsection{Advanced installation with \texttt{git}}
\label{example:sec:advancedinstallation}
One of the major advantages of \LaTeX\ is the text-based nature of reports \textit{(as compared to more complicated formats such as \texttt{.docx})} as this allows version control software, such as \texttt{git}, to track changes to a \LaTeX\ based report.

Although an in depth tutorial on using \texttt{git} is beyond the scope of this primer, a basic methodology for using the \uswdwmspkg{} with version control is detailed hereafter:

\begin{methodology0}
  \item Create a GitHub account and set up SSH keys as per the instructions at:\\
    \href{https://help.github.com/en/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh}{https://help.github.com/en/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh}
  \item Clone the \uswdwmspkg{} repository with:\\
    \term{git clone git@github.com:david-wm-sanders/latex-package-uswdwms.git}
  \item Delete the local \texttt{.git} directory
  \item Use \term{git init} to create a new repository
  \item Run \term{git add .} to add existing source \textit{(from the \uswdwmspkg{} itself)} to the new repository
  \item Commit the staged files with \term{git commit -m "Add uswdwms package framework"}
  \item Create a new repository on your GitHub account and follow the instructions, shown after repository creation, for pushing an existing repository to GitHub
\end{methodology0}

\noindent Using a \texttt{git}-based workflow makes writing a report across multiple machines or with multiple authors significantly easier.

\subsection{Usage}
\subsubsection{Basic}
To use the \uswdwmspkg{} framework on Windows:
\begin{methodology0}
  \item Ensure that:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{Python3>3.6}\footnote{\href{https://www.python.org/}{Python}} is installed
      \item The \texttt{Path} environment variable contains the \texttt{Python3x} and \texttt{Python3x\textbackslash Scripts} directories
      \item The \texttt{PATHEXT} environment variable includes \texttt{.PY;.PYW}
    \end{itemize}
  \item Install Pygments\footnote{\href{https://pypi.org/project/Pygments/}{PyPI: Pygments}} with \term{pip.exe install Pygments} \textit{(this is required for syntax highlighting in code listings, with \texttt{minted})}
  \item Check that MiKTeX, Python, and Pygments is installed correctly by compiling this primer with:\\
   \term{python.exe .\textbackslash make.py}\\
   \textit{(note: MiKTeX will pop up and ask to install missing packages - accept the installation of these glorious packages)}
  \item Comment out the \texttt{\textbackslash input} directive \textit{(as shown in Listing~\ref{example:lst:installation_and_usage:inputprimer})} in \texttt{report.tex} in order to disable displaying the primer in the compiled output PDF
  \item Add report content to \texttt{report.tex}
  \item Regularly run \term{python.exe .\textbackslash make.py} to spot \LaTeX\ syntax error issues early
\end{methodology0}

\subsubsection{Advanced usage with \texttt{git}}
For more complex reports:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Follow the advanced installation instructions in Section~\ref{example:sec:advancedinstallation} to setup a \texttt{git} repository
  \item Separate report sections into individual \texttt{.tex} files and include them with the \texttt{\textbackslash input} directive \textit{(as demonstrated in Listing~\ref{example:lst:installation_and_usage:inputprimer})}
  \item Add and commit changes to a local \texttt{git} repository after each distinct piece of work
  \item Regularly push to the remote repository on GitHub to back up changes to the report
\end{itemize}
