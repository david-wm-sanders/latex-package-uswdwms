\subsection{Document Classes}
The start of a top-level \LaTeX\ \texttt{.tex} file begins with a \term{\textbackslash documentclass[...]\{...\}} definition, as shown in Listing~\ref{example:lst:document_class:report}.

This command is used to configure options and set the document class. In the case of reports based on \uswdwmspkg{}, it is used to set the default text font size \textit{(\texttt{[12pt]})} and the document class \textit{(\texttt{article})} by default only.

\todo{talk about other documentclass opts such as draft, etc; and cover some other common classes like book, beamer, etc}
